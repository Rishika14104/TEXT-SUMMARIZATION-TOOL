SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL:

This notebook demonstrates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for generating text summaries using classical NLP techniques. The project includes:

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization (words and sentences)

Lowercasing, punctuation removal

Stopword removal

Lemmatization using NLTK

Feature Extraction:

Use of TF-IDF Vectorization to determine word importance in the text.

Summarization Function:

A custom function selects key sentences based on scores to generate a short, medium, or long summary.

The approach is rule-based and extractive, relying on statistical features to choose sentences from the original text.
