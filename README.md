SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL:

This tool is designed to automatically generate concise summaries from lengthy articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It processes the input text by cleaning, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and scoring sentences based on their importance using the TF-IDF method. Users can choose the desired summary length—short, medium, or long—and get a meaningful, reduced version of the content. Built with Python and Streamlit, the tool provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for fast and effective summarization.
